                        <p>In this Project we will be predicting the contents of an image by words one by one and make a sensible  sentence to be able to describe a image. A network of CNN and LSTM is used in this project. CNN is  used to extract features and LSTM to store the words one by one and make a sentence.However simple words in any language can be feed to the model to be  able to predict the words of the objects In an image Every day we see a lot of photographs in the  surroundings , on social media and in the newspapers. Humans are able to recognize photographs  themselves only.

                <p class="text">
                    LSTM stands for Long short-term memory; they are a type of RNN (recurrent neural network) which is  well suited for sequence prediction problems. Based on the previous text, we can predict what the next  word will be. It has proven itself effective from the traditional RNN by overcoming the limitations of  RNN which had short term memory. LSTM can carry out relevant information throughout the  processing of inputs and with a forget gate, it discards non-relevant information. LSTM will use the  information from CNN to help generate a description of the image.

            <p><b>CNN:</b></p>
                <p class="text">
                    CNN is used for extracting features from the image. CNN- Convolutional  Neural networks are specialized deep  neural networks which can process the data that has input shape like a 2D matrix. Images are easily represented as  a 2D matrix and CNN is very useful in working with images. CNN is basically used for image classifications and  identifying if an image is a bird, a plane or Superman, etc. It scans images from left to right and top to bottom to  pull out important features from the image and combines the feature to classify images. It can handle the images  that have been translated, rotated, scaled and changes in perspective.

                                Image caption generators can be used to create educational content that is more engaging and accessible to students. For example, image caption generators can be used to create interactive learning materials that allow students to explore images and to learn about the concepts that they represent.
                                Image caption generators are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the way that we interact with images. By providing textual descriptions of images, image caption generators can help us to better understand the world around us, to find the information that we are looking for, and to engage in more meaningful conversations.
